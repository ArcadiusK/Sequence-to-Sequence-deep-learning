# Sequence-to-Sequence-deep-learning
Tensor flow used to implement Deep Learning model called Sequence-to-Sequence

This project is a neural network machine translation model that consists of a sequence to sequence model that is trained on a dataset of sentences that can translate new sentences from one language to another.
